Creating a C# console application.
â€¢ Create three applications: Grade Calculator, Ticket Price Calculator and a Triangle
Type Identifier.
Grade Calculator
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a numerical grade between 0 and 100. Based
on the grade entered, display the corresponding letter grade using the following scale:
- 90 and above: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- Below 60: F
Ticket Price Calculator
A movie theater sells tickets for GHC10. However, if a customer is a senior citizen (age 65
and above) or a child (age 12 and below), they receive a discounted price of GHC7. Write a
program that prompts the user to enter their age and calculates the ticket price based on the
age entered. Display the ticket price accordingly.
Triangle Type Identifier
Write a program that prompts the user to enter three sides of a triangle. Based on the lengths
of the sides entered, determine and display the type of the triangle. The possible types are:
- Equilateral: All three sides are equal.
- Isosceles: Two sides are equal.
- Scalene: No sides are equal.
